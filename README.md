xmonad-utils
============

A small collection of X utilities useful when running XMonad. It includes:

* hxsel, which returns the text currently in the X selection;

* hslock, a simple X screen lock;

* hmanage: an utility to toggle the [override-redirect property] of any window; [See also](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8867715/xlib-center-window)

* and hhp, a simple utility to hide the pointer, similar to unclutter.

This git repo was cloned from the darcs repo at http://gorgias.mine.nu/repos/xmonad-utils/.
It appeared dormant, so I decided to clone the repo and publish a version that compiles on modern GHC.
